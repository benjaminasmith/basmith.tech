I pride myself on my ability to ensure that clients are kept in the loop and that the job is done quickly and thoroughly.\n","date":"10 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/computer-hardware--software-repair/","section":"Work Experience","summary":"","title":"Computer Hardware \u0026 Software Repair","type":"portfolio"},{"content":"From April of 2022 to now I have worked in Enterprise IT Support, specifically in the Education industry.
